## Simple-Neural-Networks
Creating some simple Neural Networks using python

Each neural network is coded from a neuron level
Weight, delta's gradient decents and bais values are calculated and back-propagation is applied to optimize the final weights.

### This Repo consists of 7 Neural Networks / Folders
## All of the networks cover the same problem of determining weather a point lies above the line or below the line.
```
1. Single Neuron: A single neuron is used and the activation function is linear
2. Neural Network - 2 
3. Neural Network - 3 
4. Neural Network - 4 
5. Neural Network - 5 
6. Neural Network - 6: OOP's concepts is used to implement the entire neural network
7. Intro to deep learning: consists of notebooks which gives an introduction to Tensorflow.
