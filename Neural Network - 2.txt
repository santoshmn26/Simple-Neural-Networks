The second neural network problem is a little bit advanced compared to the first neural network. In this example we try to differenciate
a group of points in a 2-Dimensional graph given the line y=0.3x+2, any points above this line is treated that it will belong to class '0'
any point that lies below this line is treated as class '1'. 
We use a single neuron for this example but we use two inputs 
  1. x location
  2. y location
But we have only one output that is either class '0' or class '1'.
